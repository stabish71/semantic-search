Why should I buy Arya Health Plan?\n\nWhile your corporate health cover offers some protection, it's important to remember that it's tied to your employment and may not fully meet your healthcare needs. Here’s why:\n\n \n\nYou will lose your coverage should you change jobs.\nThe sum insured may not be enough to cover major expenses.\nRestrictions on room type and rent could limit your comfort.\nEssential consumables like bandages and syringes (which make up 10-15% of your bill) often may not be covered.\nRoutine care may have little to no coverage.\nThere's typically no proactive support to keep you healthy in the long run.\n\n \n\nThat's why having an Arya Health Plan 1 is so important. Taking this step now gives you peace of mind, knowing you're taken care when you are healthy and protected no matter what life brings.\n\nI want to understand how does top-up work?\n\nConsider that you have a corporate cover of Rs 2 lac with your employer and you wish to top-up this 2 Lac coverage to 50 Lac of coverage with Arya Health Plan 1\n\n \n\nThis is how it will work:\n\n1. You will only pay for coverage of only INR 48 Lacs for Arya Health Plan and receive great savings on premium!\n2. In case of hospitalization claim, your corporate cover will take care of the initial INR 2 Lacs of bill, post which Arya Health Plan coverage will trigger, and pay eligible expenses up to the remaining INR 48 Lacs.\n\n \n\nIn summary, you will be buying Arya Health Plan with a deductible of Rs 2 lacs.\n\n\nFollowing deductible options are available:\n- INR 25,000\n- INR 50,000\n- INR 1,00,000\n- INR 2,00,000\n- INR 5,00,000\n\nI already have an existing retail health insurance. Why should I buy Arya Health plan?\n\nIt's great that you already have a retail health insurance plan for yourself and your family—this is an important step in protecting your health. But is it sufficient? We believe it’s not as they are not comprehensive enough, have limits on coverage, have confusing T&Cs​ leading to poor experience at time of claim.\n\n \n\nArya Health Plan 1 goes beyond typical coverage and are designed not only to cover you when you're sick but also to help keep you healthy. We’re committed to your well-being, so if you fall sick and need surgery despite our efforts, we’ll refund your entire yearly premium on top of covering all your hospital bills guaranteeing Zero out-of-pocket expenses. This way, you can focus solely on recovery, while we take care of everything else.\n\nWhy is a health check-up required before buying Arya Health Plan 1\n\nWe are your partners in helping you get well and stay healthy. To do so, we both need to understand your current health. Our Care Management team will support you step by step to help you adhere to your doctor-directed health management plan. Together, your doctor, our team, and you will work to keep you out of the hospital. \n\n \n\nOnce you have completed your initial health check-up and we have accepted you for coverage, your policy can never be cancelled (as long as you pay the due premium on time), regardless of future changes to your health. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing there won’t be any unexpected claim rejections.\n\nWill the price increase because of the health checkup?\n\nThere are no additional payments required by you to get the health check-up done.\n\n \n\nHowever, depending on the results of the health check-up, your premium may increase if health markers suggests that your current health condition in outside normal parameters.\n\n \n\nIn certain cases, we may defer the issuance of subscription for Arya Health Plan 1 and Plan 2 and coverage.\n\nWhich family members can be added to the plan?\n\nSelf, Spouse, Children (>3 months to 25 years), Parents and Parents-in-law\n\nWhat does the OneHealth Promise benefit in Arya Health Plan 1 ?\n\nIt's our job to keep you healthy - and out of the hospital. That's why we will return your premium if you get hospitalized for a surgery due to a health issue as an Arya Health Plan member.\n\nWhich hospitals and clinics is covered under Arya Health Plan?\n\nFor hospitalization, your coverage extends to all 21 Narayana Health hospitals across India.\n\n \n\nFor routine care (OPD), you're covered at all Narayana One Health Clinics and Narayana Health hospitals.\n\nDo I need to pay myself for consumables like bandages, syringes, etc.for hospitalization?\n\nNo, you don't need to pay.\n\n \n\nConsumables and non-medical expenses during hospitalization are covered with Arya Health Plan 1, guaranteeing Zero out-of-pocket expenses from your end.\n\n \n\nConsumables and non-medical expenses typically make up 10-15% of your hospital bill. Most insurance products do not provide cover for this.\n\nWhat room-type and room-rent for hospitalization will I be covered for?\n\nAt Narayana Health, there are no limits on room type or room rent.\n\n \n\nWe understand that your comfort is a top priority during challenging times, and we ensure you have the flexibility to choose the room that suits you best.\n\nCan I port my policy to Arya Health Plan?\n\nYes, you can port your existing policy to Arya Health Plan.\n\nCan I use an Arya health plan outside of Narayana Health network?\n\nYes, your Arya health plan provides coverage outside the Narayana Health network in specific situations.​\n\nWhile we recommend using the Narayana Health network for seamless coverage, we understand that there are times when this may not be possible. In such cases, we’ve got you covered:​\n\n \n\n1.  Medical Emergencies: If you are travelling and the Narayana Health network is unavailable at your location.​\n\n2. Travel Situations: If you’re travelling and there’s no Narayana Health facility nearby.​\n\n3. Unavailability of Treatment: If the required treatment isn’t offered within the Narayana Health network at that time.​\n\n4. Relocation: If you’ve moved to a new location where Narayana Health facilities are unavailable.​\n\n \n\nFor any claims or queries, feel free to reach out to our support team.\n\nWhat sum insured does Arya health plan have?\n\nWe have multiple sum insured options ranging from ₹25 Lacs up to ₹1Crore.​\n\nWhat happens in case of emergency or travel if treatment is taken at other out-of-network hospitals?\n\nOur primary purpose is to provide you with healthcare whenever you need it. While we require you to seek treatment within the Narayana Health network for coverage, we also provide coverage outside the network in the following scenarios:​\n\n \n\nIn case of an emergency, when you seek care at the nearest hospital, please refer to the points below for the definition of an emergency:​\n\n1.  If you are travelling and the Narayana Health network is unavailable at your location.​\n2. If the required treatment is not available within the Narayana Health network.​\n3. If you have relocated to a new location where Narayana Health is unavailable.\n\nHow do I claim with Arya health plan?\n\nFor planned admissions, please call us so we can prepare everything for you in advance. At the Hospital, you will be supported by our care team at every step of the way. Alternately, please present the Digital Health Card we issue at the Insurance Desk, and we'll handle the rest. We want you to feel comfortable and focus solely on your recovery, while we take care of everything else.\n\nALL\nHEALTH.\nNO\nEXCUSES.\nInformation\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nAbout Us\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nKnowledge\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nClinics\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nSocial\nInstagram\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nYoutube\nGet the app\nCopyright @ 2024.

That’s why we offer personalized consultations. Our experts will assess your concerns, discuss your goals, and recommend a treatment plan tailored just for you.\nWhat services do you offer at your skin and hair clinic?\nAt our clinic, we provide a range of dermatology, aesthetic, and cosmetology services. From acne treatments, anti-aging solutions, and laser therapies to hair restoration, chemical peels, and advanced skincare, our focus is on helping you look and feel your best.\nAre your treatments safe?\nAbsolutely. All our treatments are performed by doctors themselves or closely supervised by them, using the latest technologies (FDA approved) and highest-quality products. Your safety and comfort are our top priorities, and we follow strict protocols to ensure everything is done in a safe and hygienic environment.\nHow long will it take to see results?\nResults vary depending on the treatment and your individual skin or hair condition. Some treatments, like facials or peels, can give you an instant glow, while others, such as hair restoration or laser treatments, might take a few sessions to show noticeable improvement. During your consultation, we’ll give you a clear idea of what to expect.\nDoes laser hair reduction hurt?\nMost people experience minimal discomfort during laser hair reduction. It’s often compared to a slight snapping feeling on the skin, but our advanced lasers are designed to be as comfortable as possible. We also offer cooling mechanisms and numbing creams to help reduce any sensation.\nHow do I prepare for my appointment?\nWe’ll guide you through specific pre-treatment instructions depending on the service you're coming in for. For example, if you’re getting laser hair reduction, we might ask you to avoid sun exposure and shave the area being treated. Don’t worry—we’ll give you all the details before your visit!\nHow many sessions do I need?\nThis really depends on the treatment. Some treatments, like chemical peels, may only require one session, while others, like laser hair removal or hair restoration, may need multiple sessions to achieve optimal results. We’ll walk you through the process during your consultation and create a customized plan based on your needs.\nWill there be downtime after the treatment?\nMany of our treatments have little to no downtime, meaning you can get back to your day right away. However, some treatments like chemical peels or laser therapy might leave mild redness or sensitivity for a short time. We’ll make sure you know what to expect before and after your treatment.\nCan I book an appointment for multiple treatments on the same day?\nYes! We offer flexible appointment scheduling so you can combine treatments if needed. If you’re interested in a combination of services, just let us know, and we’ll help you plan the perfect self-care day.\nHow do I take care of my skin/hair after treatment?\nPost-treatment care is super important!

It involves using drugs that destroy cancer cells by entirely stopping or slowing down their growth. Chemotherapy is generally used to treat recurrent cancers (when cancer cells reemerge after treatment) or metastatic cancers (cancer cells that spread to other parts of the body).\n\n \n\nChemotherapy drugs can be administered orally, intravenously, or injected directly into the fluid surrounding the brain or the abdominal cavity, depending on the specific diagnosis.\n\nThere Are Three Types of Chemotherapy\nNeoadjuvant Chemotherapy\n\nUsually done before the surgical or radiation procedures. It is recommended when the tumours are too big to be operated or when the location of the tumour is difficult to operate. The drugs used in Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy reduce the size of the tumour to enable surgery.\n\nAdjuvant Chemotherapy\n\nDelivered after surgical or radiation procedures. It helps clean up any remaining cancer cells that are not visible in the imaging tests. This treatment helps to reduce the chances of recurrence of cancer.\n\nPalliative Chemotherapy\n\nThis is recommended to manage the symptoms of chronic cancer to improve quality of life.\n\nSide-Effects of Chemotherapy\n\nApart from destroying the cancerous cells, chemotherapy drugs also tend to destroy the rapidly dividing healthy cells present in the intestines, mouth, etc., which results in some side effects. The side effects of chemotherapy generally disappear once the treatment ends. Some side effects of chemotherapy include:\n\nHair loss\nVomiting or nausea\nAnaemia\nFatigue\nDiarrhoea\nMouth sores\nLow platelet count\nBook An Appointment\nOur Facility\nAdvanced cancer care you can trust\n\nRemember that medical science is making rapid progress, with new and improved cancer treatments being introduced regularly.

    "content": "Become an Arya Member\nHome\nBlogs\nShield Your ...\nShield Your Future: Embrace Preventive Healthcare\n\nDiscover the Importance of Regular Health Checkups for a Healthier Tomorrow\n\n17 Oct 2021\n22 min read\nShare \n\nDo you often feel extra tired or stressed, even when you haven’t done anything mentally or physically exhausting? Or maybe you’ve noticed a bit of discomfort that doesn’t seem severe enough to check out, yet it lingers, affecting your daily life. Often, these minor but persistent symptoms are our body’s way of signalling underlying issues that could worsen if ignored.\n\nThis is where preventive healthcare comes in. It helps you take charge early, detecting health risks through regular checkups and screenings before they escalate. It safeguards against future complications, enhances your vitality, and fortifies your well-being. Staying proactive with your preventive healthcare steps, you can tackle many issues even before the occurrence of symptoms.\n\nWhile we all understand “why is healthcare important,” there remains a significant lack of attention to preventive healthcare, which is concerning.\n\n \n\nPreventive Care for Adults: Symptoms and Screenings\n\nVarious symptom-specific screenings can help pinpoint potential issues, aiding in early detection and timely intervention. For example, persistent fatigue might be linked to anaemia, low vitamin levels, or even early signs of diabetes. Screenings for this may include:\n\nA simple blood test can check for deficiencies in essential vitamins\nA blood glucose test can screen for diabetes\n\nThese tests help catch the issues before they become severe.  \n\nSimilarly, fluctuating blood pressure might indicate hypertension or an early risk for cardiovascular disease, which can be managed effectively with regular monitoring and lifestyle adjustments if detected early\n\nPreventive healthcare services provide essential insights that go beyond visible symptoms. \n\nRegular blood pressure checks, cholesterol assessments, and blood glucose tests offer a window into your heart and metabolic health\nCardiovascular screenings, such as EKGs and stress tests, are invaluable for those with risk factors, like a sedentary lifestyle or family history, and can uncover issues that may not yet present symptoms\n\nBy staying proactive with the screenings and tests, you can manage your health more effectively, preventing or mitigating severe conditions. With a holistic approach to preventive care, you can stay informed and take control of your well-being before issues progress.\n\n \n\nPreventive Healthcare: Understanding its Benefits\n\nMany wonder if preventive healthcare truly makes a difference.  \n\nThink of preventive care as a proactive approach to your health. It's designed to keep issues at bay rather than waiting for symptoms to appear. It's more than just checkups—it's an ongoing commitment to staying well and addressing any risks early.\n\n1. Fewer Health Complications \n\nOne of the most valuable aspects of preventive healthcare is its role in catching potential health concerns before they escalate. Routine screenings, such as blood pressure or diabetes checks, are subtle yet powerful tools that help identify problems early. Preventive steps, such as vaccinations, can also protect you from specific diseases altogether, allowing you to focus on enjoying life without worrying about avoidable health problems. \n\n2. Reduced Healthcare Costs Over Time\n\nThe concern about the rising cost of healthcare is evident and justified, too. Addressing potential health issues early minimises the need for more intensive, costly treatments down the road. For instance, a simple vaccination can shield you from a disease that might otherwise lead to extended hospital stays and expensive interventions.\n\n3. A More Active, Productive Life\n\nStaying healthy isn’t just about avoiding illness; it’s about living a fulfilling life. Preventive care allows you to remain active, engaged, and ready to embrace each day. By maintaining good health, you’re better able to pursue the things that matter most to you. Regular checkups and healthy habits keep you physically and mentally sharp.\n\n4. Overall Physical and Mental Well-being\n\nPreventive healthcare is a holistic approach to well-being. For example, regular exercise helps keep your muscles strong and your mind clear. Coupled with preventive checkups and lifestyle guidance, it becomes easier to maintain a balanced, healthy lifestyle.\n\n5. Lower Stress Levels and Peace of Mind\n\nAn often-overlooked benefit of preventive healthcare is the peace of mind it brings. Knowing your health is monitored regularly can ease any lingering anxieties about potential health issues. Preventive care is not about endless doctor visits—it’s about creating a sustainable path to better health.\n\n \n\nWhy Consider Practicing Preventive Healthcare?\n\nThere are some definite reasons to consider practicing preventive care.\n\nWeight Management: Maintaining a healthy weight is essential to reducing various health risks, including diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. Eat healthy and exercise regularly to prevent obesity\nIdentifying Potential Issues Early: Annual checkups and routine blood tests are crucial for preventive healthcare. Some mandatory physical checkups should include cholesterol, blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, PCOD, bone density, etc.\nFor Your Mental Well-being: Mental wellness is a vital aspect of preventive healthcare. It can address anxiety, depression, and other concerns before they escalate\nStaying Protected: Staying current on immunisations protects against infectious diseases, particularly for vulnerable populations. Vaccines do not just protect you. They protect all of us from spreading infectious and contagious diseases\n\n \n\nPreventive Healthcare: Who Are the Most Vulnerable Populations?\n\nPreventive healthcare is crucial for maintaining long-term health, and specific populations can significantly benefit from it. \n\nLet’s understand who can benefit the most from preventive healthcare.\n\n1. People with Chronic Conditions\n\nIndividuals living with chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, or cardiovascular disease, require ongoing preventive healthcare. This includes:\n\nMonitoring vital signs,\nAdjusting medications, and  \nReceiving regular screenings for potential complications associated with their condition\n\n2. People with Unhealthy Lifestyles\n\nIndividuals who lead sedentary lifestyles, have poor dietary habits, or smoke or consume alcohol excessively are at a higher risk for a range of health problems. Preventive healthcare for these individuals can include:  \n\nCounselling on lifestyle changes,\nRegular screenings for metabolic conditions, and \nGuidance on nutritional improvements and physical activity\n\n3. Individuals with a Family History of Health Conditions\n\nPeople with a family history of diseases like cancer, heart disease, or autoimmune conditions are more likely to develop these conditions themselves.\n\nGenetic screenings,\nRegular checkups, and \nSpecific preventive measures, such as colonoscopies or mammograms, are recommended to catch potential issues before they progress\n\n4. People in High-Stress Jobs\n\nHigh-stress occupations, such as those in healthcare, law enforcement, and corporate environments, can take a toll on mental and physical health, leading to conditions like hypertension, burnout, and depression. Preventive healthcare for individuals in these roles includes:\n\nMental health support, \nStress management strategies, \nRegular blood pressure and heart health screenings, and  \nWellness programmes\n\n5. Elderly Individuals\n\nAgeing naturally increases the risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and certain cancers. Elderly individuals benefit significantly from preventive healthcare measures like:  \n\nRegular screenings, \nBone density tests, \nBlood pressure monitoring, and \nVaccinations (e.g., flu and pneumonia vaccines)\n\n \n\nWhen to Consult\n\nReady to take control of your health and catch potential issues before they start? It is time to consult a general physician right away! Guided preventive care can be a decisive step in protecting your future well-being. A doctor can help you assess your unique health risks and recommend screenings that fit your needs, helping you stay a step ahead.  \n\nDon’t wait for symptoms to appear—schedule an appointment today to create a personalised preventive care plan that supports a healthier, more fulfilling life. \n\n \n\nIn a Nutshell\n\nPreventive healthcare is a proactive strategy for maintaining your overall health and restraining certain illnesses. By scheduling regular screenings, making informed lifestyle choices, and staying abreast with vaccinations, you can reduce your risk of chronic diseases and improve your quality of life. \n\nTake preventive healthcare as seriously as you take medications and hospitalisations. Only prevention will save you from stress, tiredness, and expenses. It will lead you to live a healthier and more fulfilling life.  \n\n \n\nFAQs\n\n1. What’s the difference between a preventive test and a diagnostic test? \n\nPreventive tests screen asymptomatic individuals for early signs of disease. On the contrary, diagnostic tests identify diseases with specific symptoms. Diagnostic tests help confirm a disease. \n\n2. When should I schedule preventive care screenings? \n\nFrequency depends on your health, age, and risk factors. Annual checkups are generally recommended. However, certain screenings, like mammograms or cholesterol checks, follow specific age guidelines.\n\n3. Does insurance cover preventive care?\n\nMany insurance plans cover preventive care services. However, coverage specifics can vary. Reviewing your plan’s details or consulting with your provider can clarify the included services. \n\n4. What are the characteristics of preventive care?\n\nPreventive care involves screenings, immunisations, counselling, and lifestyle recommendations. These aim to avert disease and support long-term health. \n\n5. What are the characteristics of preventive care?\n\nPreventive care helps catch health concerns early, reduces healthcare expenses, and supports a healthier life by addressing risks proactively. \n\nALL\nHEALTH.\nNO\nEXCUSES.\nInformation\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nAbout Us\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nKnowledge\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nClinics\nArya Health Plan\nDoctors\nClinics\nSocial\nInstagram\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nYoutube\nGet the app\nCopyright @ 2024.

Why should I buy Arya Health Plan?\n\nWhile your corporate health cover offers some protection, it's important to remember that it's tied to your employment and may not fully meet your healthcare needs. Here’s why:\n\n \n\nYou will lose your coverage should you change jobs.\nThe sum insured may not be enough to cover major expenses.\nRestrictions on room type and rent could limit your comfort.\nEssential consumables like bandages and syringes (which make up 10-15% of your bill) often may not be covered.\nRoutine care may have little to no coverage.\nThere's typically no proactive support to keep you healthy in the long run.\n\n \n\nThat's why having an Arya Health Plan 1 is so important. Taking this step now gives you peace of mind, knowing you're taken care when you are healthy and protected no matter what life brings.\n\nI want to understand how does top-up work?\n\nConsider that you have a corporate cover of Rs 2 lac with your employer and you wish to top-up this 2 Lac coverage to 50 Lac of coverage with Arya Health Plan 1\n\n \n\nThis is how it will work:\n\n1. You will only pay for coverage of only INR 48 Lacs for Arya Health Plan and receive great savings on premium!\n2. In case of hospitalization claim, your corporate cover will take care of the initial INR 2 Lacs of bill, post which Arya Health Plan coverage will trigger, and pay eligible expenses up to the remaining INR 48 Lacs.\n\n \n\nIn summary, you will be buying Arya Health Plan with a deductible of Rs 2 lacs.\n\n\nFollowing deductible options are available:\n- INR 25,000\n- INR 50,000\n- INR 1,00,000\n- INR 2,00,000\n- INR 5,00,000\n\nI already have an existing retail health insurance. Why should I buy Arya Health plan?\n\nIt's great that you already have a retail health insurance plan for yourself and your family—this is an important step in protecting your health. But is it sufficient? We believe it’s not as they are not comprehensive enough, have limits on coverage, have confusing T&Cs​ leading to poor experience at time of claim.\n\n \n\nArya Health Plan 1 goes beyond typical coverage and are designed not only to cover you when you're sick but also to help keep you healthy. We’re committed to your well-being, so if you fall sick and need surgery despite our efforts, we’ll refund your entire yearly premium on top of covering all your hospital bills guaranteeing Zero out-of-pocket expenses. This way, you can focus solely on recovery, while we take care of everything else.\n\nWhy is a health check-up required before buying Arya Health Plan 1\n\nWe are your partners in helping you get well and stay healthy. To do so, we both need to understand your current health. Our Care Management team will support you step by step to help you adhere to your doctor-directed health management plan. Together, your doctor, our team, and you will work to keep you out of the hospital. \n\n \n\nOnce you have completed your initial health check-up and we have accepted you for coverage, your policy can never be cancelled (as long as you pay the due premium on time), regardless of future changes to your health. This way, you can have peace of mind knowing there won’t be any unexpected claim rejections.\n\nWill the price increase because of the health checkup?\n\nThere are no additional payments required by you to get the health check-up done.\n\n \n\nHowever, depending on the results of the health check-up, your premium may increase if health markers suggests that your current health condition in outside normal parameters.\n\n \n\nIn certain cases, we may defer the issuance of subscription for Arya Health Plan 1 and Plan 2 and coverage.\n\nWhich family members can be added to the plan?\n\nSelf, Spouse, Children (>3 months to 25 years), Parents and Parents-in-law\n\nWhat does the OneHealth Promise benefit in Arya Health Plan 1 ?\n\nIt's our job to keep you healthy - and out of the hospital. That's why we will return your premium if you get hospitalized for a surgery due to a health issue as an Arya Health Plan member.\n\nWhich hospitals and clinics is covered under Arya Health Plan?\n\nFor hospitalization, your coverage extends to all 21 Narayana Health hospitals across India.\n\n \n\nFor routine care (OPD), you're covered at all Narayana One Health Clinics and Narayana Health hospitals.\n\nDo I need to pay myself for consumables like bandages, syringes, etc.for hospitalization?\n\nNo, you don't need to pay.\n\n \n\nConsumables and non-medical expenses during hospitalization are covered with Arya Health Plan 1, guaranteeing Zero out-of-pocket expenses from your end.\n\n \n\nConsumables and non-medical expenses typically make up 10-15% of your hospital bill. Most insurance products do not provide cover for this.\n\nWhat room-type and room-rent for hospitalization will I be covered for?\n\nAt Narayana Health, there are no limits on room type or room rent.\n\n \n\nWe understand that your comfort is a top priority during challenging times, and we ensure you have the flexibility to choose the room that suits you best.\n\nCan I port my policy to Arya Health Plan?\n\nYes, you can port your existing policy to Arya Health Plan.\n\nCan I use an Arya health plan outside of Narayana Health network?\n\nYes, your Arya health plan provides coverage outside the Narayana Health network in specific situations.​\n\nWhile we recommend using the Narayana Health network for seamless coverage, we understand that there are times when this may not be possible. In such cases, we’ve got you covered:​\n\n \n\n1.  Medical Emergencies: If you are travelling and the Narayana Health network is unavailable at your location.​\n\n2. Travel Situations: If you’re travelling and there’s no Narayana Health facility nearby.​\n\n3. Unavailability of Treatment: If the required treatment isn’t offered within the Narayana Health network at that time.​\n\n4. Relocation: If you’ve moved to a new location where Narayana Health facilities are unavailable.​\n\n \n\nFor any claims or queries, feel free to reach out to our support team.\n\nWhat sum insured does Arya health plan have?\n\nWe have multiple sum insured options ranging from ₹25 Lacs up to ₹1Crore.​\n\nWhat happens in case of emergency or travel if treatment is taken at other out-of-network hospitals?\n\nOur primary purpose is to provide you with healthcare whenever you need it.

If the required treatment is not available within the Narayana Health network.​\n3. If you have relocated to a new location where Narayana Health is unavailable.\n\nHow do I claim with Arya health plan?\n\nFor planned admissions, please call us so we can prepare everything for you in advance.
